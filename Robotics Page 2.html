<h2>Robotic team</h2>
<p>The Lo-Ellen Robotics team is composed of an extremely diverse group of people. Students from grades 9 to 12 who are interested in a variety of subjects from applied mechanical engineering to theoretical mathematics have come together to cooperate and share ideas. The inclusive social environment of Team 4069 is ideal for fostering long-term friendships in additionto new technological skills. As the team is very new, the focus will be the successful introduction of the team into the school and community. This year, we plan to create a working robot, compete in Robotics Contests, the first being the Waterloo Regional in March of 2013. </p>
