<h2>Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School</h2>
<p>With a population of 750 students, Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School is relatively small, however it has a large impact in the community. With pupils representing many diverse ethnicities, Lo-Ellen frequently hosts international exchange students, and sends its alumni to represent it around the world.</p>
<p>Lo-Ellen's student population is also extremely diverse in terms of interests. With the International Baccalaureate Programme, the school attracts young people who are hard workers and enjoy academic challenges. However, Lo-Ellen also has a music and theatre arts program and an athletics program, both well recognized throughout the community. Many Lo-Ellen students help out in the community; from volunteering at the hospital, to planting trees, to attending Amnesty International youth conferences.</p>
<p>The school is accepting of its diverse students. Whether you enjoy mechanics, visual arts, or writing math contests, Lo-Ellen provides you with an inclusive learning environment.</p>
<p><a name="us" id="us"></a></p>
<h2>Robotic team</h2>
<p>The Lo-Ellen Robotics team composes an extremely diverse group. Students from grades 9 to 12 interested in a variety of subjects from applied mechanibcal engineering to theoretical mathematics have come together to realize their goal. The inclusive social environment is ideal for fostering long-term friendships on top of new technological skills. As the team is very new, its focus will be the successful introduction into the school and community culture. Through the creation of a working robot, the team will compete in Robotics Contests, the first to be the Waterloo Regional in March of 2012. As well as competing, the team will introduce the experience to the community.
With the first robotics team in Sudbury, the responsibility falls to Lo-Ellen Park to engage others in the experience.</p>
<p>Following the successful creation of a working robot, the team will visit other schools throughout the city to encourage engagement in technology from a young age.</p>
<p><a name="first" id="first"></a></p>
<h2>FIRST Robotics Competition</h2>
<p>For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Techonolgy (FIRST) is an annual international competition which takes place in St. Louis. In FIRST students are only given 6 weeks to design and build a robot. After the 6 weeks they compete against other teams to win.</p>
<h3>FIRST's mission</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>
